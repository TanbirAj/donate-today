        <h1>Their lives depend on your donatetion</h1>
        
        <p>One of the better ways to help the poor and needy people is to give them a hand up rather than a hand out. Giving them moral support, showing heartfelt humility and respect makes them aware that someone really does care about them and trying to improve their condition. By providing them with the opportunities to improve their condition on their own
        would increase their self-esteem and help them in overcoming barriers they face everyday. Work with the poor and needy people and help them discover their own capabilities and capacity and putting them to use at the right place at the right time. Support them and let them know that they have something of value which can be used for meeting their
        basic requirements.</p>

        <h1>They need us to survive</h1>
        <p>Provide nutritious meals to the poor and needy people. Donating groceries can help end the hunger of poor and needy
        people. They cannot even afford a single time meal for themselves and their family, so donating food will make their
        stomach fill and stay healthy. Rather than wasting food or throwing it, it is better to give it to a needy person.</p>
